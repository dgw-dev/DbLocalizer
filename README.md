# DbLocalizer

# Introduction 
This project is for developers and organizations looking for a simple way to export localizable data from, and import localized data to a SQL Server database, via a Translation Management System (TMS). The first release shipps with an implementation of the Smartling plugin, which will act as a starting point for you oww implementation. Over time I hope to be able to add more plugins for different TMS applications.
