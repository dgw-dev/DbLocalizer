# DbLocalizer

# Introduction 
This project is for developers and organizations looking for a simple way to export localizable data from, and import localized data to a SQL Server database, via a Translation Management System (TMS). The first release ships with an implementation of the Smartling plugin, which will act as a starting point for your own implementation. Over time I hope to be able to add more plugins for different TMS applications.

This is a .NET Core Web API application, with the option to add a UI of your choice, either through MVC or a static UI in the wwwroot. The advantage of making the app a service is that it can then be integrated into business processes, allowing user interaction and extensibility. It will also support automation through scheduled jobs.
